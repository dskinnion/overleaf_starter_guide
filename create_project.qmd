# Creating a New Project {.sec-create_project}

These instructions are for projects that are hosted on GitHub, not those that just exist on Overleaf. In other words, we want you to use Overleaf as if it were an IDE for editing TeX files, not as a file storage suite as Google Docs may be. This will make it so that 1) you can collaborate with others who do not use overleaf, 2) you can keep a consistent repository space (GitHub) for all of your projects, and 3) your LaTeX files can live in the same repository as your data, etc.
