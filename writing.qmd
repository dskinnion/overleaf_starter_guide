# Writing Your Document {.sec-writing}

You can start writing your document directly in the text editor using LaTeX syntax. Here are some basic LaTeX commands to get you started:

* Document Structure: Begin with a preamble where you specify the document class, packages, and settings. The main content of your document is enclosed between \\begin{document} and \\end{document} tags.
* Sections and Subsections: Use commands like \\section{} and \\subsection{} to organize your document into sections and subsections.
* Text Formatting: Apply formatting such as bold, italics, and underline using commands like \\textbf{}, \\textit{}, and \\underline{} respectively.
* Lists: Create itemized or numbered lists using the itemize or enumerate environments.
* Math Equations: LaTeX excels at typesetting mathematical equations. Use the \$ ... \$ or \[ ... \] delimiters for inline or displayed equations respectively.
* Figures and Tables: Insert figures and tables using the \includegraphics{} and table environments respectively.
